# Project Documentation

This is your project's documentation which is stored in the `src/project/docs/` folder. Documentation for individual components should be put into the component's folder under `src/docs/`.

Files may be written in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) or <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.
