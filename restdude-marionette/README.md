How to use

Start the Node Express server using Grunt - This is used for persistent storage of your todo list entries.

grunt backend
Start the frontend server using Grunt - This is the Javascript application. Your terminal will tell you to point your browser at 0.0.0.0:9000 so see the application.

grunt frontend
You can then point as many tabs/browsers at 0.0.0.0:9000 as you like. Use the form to add items to your todo list, you will see your changes appear on the other tabs in real time. Thanks to Socket IO.
