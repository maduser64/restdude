I downloaded the TTF files from Google at https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/master/apache/opensans/ . These files contain all glyphs/characters (extended Latin, Cyrillic, etc); see `METADATA.json` for details.

I used Font Squirrel to generate the EOT, WOFF, and WOFF2 files. Below is the contents of the `generator_config.txt` file that it spits out so you can perform the generation with the same settings again. Briefly, I kept the TTF files' hinting and did not subset the characters.

One could download the other font formats from Google using http://www.localfont.com however the files were much smaller â€“ I suspect they are only including the standard Latin/Western subset of glyphs.

The TTF fonts can also be downloaded from https://googlefontdirectory.googlecode.com/hg/apache/ including a separate Hebrew set.
